      Fun fact! The Dead Sea is the saltiest body of water in the world, set to dry out completely, experts say, by the year 2050. Fiorucci loves travel – and hates FOMO. Which is why we sent supermodel Georgia May Jagger for a splash around in these sun-drenched waters for our summer ‘17 campaign shoot. Below, in conversation with IDEA Books’ David Owen, she explains what went&nbsp;down.

      G: We weren’t really given a shot list, so we did what we felt in the moment and just went with it. I think it was quite amazing the way we did it. It was similar to the way my mum [ex-model Jerry Hall] describes to me how the old Vogue trips were. They used to tell them to go ahead of time, get a tan and then they would spend a week at the location. It felt very much like that kind of vibe. Whereas now, we are so used to everything being like: ‘We have ten shots and we have to do them all now’. But in fact, we actually ended up with more pictures the way we did it because there was less pressure and it felt more&nbsp;real.
