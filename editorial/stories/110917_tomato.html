    Tomatoes are good for you. Plus, they taste nice. But they can also get messy. Here’s
    proof: La Tomatina, a pretty-much- totally-insane tomato-throwing festival that takes
    place every year in Buñol, Valencia. Where better to test out Fiorucci’s water-proof
    ponchos? That’s exactly what we did this August, the help of model and performance
    artist Maya Coline., Here’s how it went, according to Maya.

        Did you know about La Tomatina before you went?
      </div>
      <div class="interview__answer b2">
        No, I didn’t know about the festival exactly, but I love the movie We Need to Talk About
        Kevin. And it has loads of references to it. So when they told me we were going to La
        Tomatina I thought, oh, yeah, that’s it. In the movie there’s a scene where people are
        throwing tomatoes at the main character, who’s played by Tilda Swinton. It’s a great movie.
        You need to see it!

        What was it like?
      </div>
      <div class="interview__answer b2">
        There’s a main street where all the tomato throwing takes place. And then there is a little street going off, a sloping street. And there, the ground turned into a kind of red torrent, it
was crazy.

How does it all start?
      </div>
      <div class="interview__answer b2">
People arrive in the village really early, like six in the morning. They come by bus. Then you
need to walk a bit to arrive to the main zone. Then there these huge trunks full of tomatoes
that pass down the main street. And it’s like the tomato delivery. And at this moment
people are really getting crazy. They push to the front to get to the tomatoes first. And they
take glasses and scoop up the juice from the floor and then throw it everywhere. There are
really no rules after that.

        What was your favourite thing about the trip?
      </div>
      <div class="interview__answer b2">
        Well… Josh was like, “You’re going to be the one being pelted with tomatoes. I’ll photograph
you.” And I feel like he was pretty sure that he wasn’t going to get any tomatoes on himself.
But of course it didn’t happen like that. He couldn’t take pictures and escape it all the same
time. And I had a Fiorucci poncho, I was really protected. But he didn’t have anything like
that! So he was more covered with tomatoes than I was. So I liked that the photographer
was in the same situation as the model, that was interesting.

So you’d say that the Fiorucci poncho was pretty tomato-proof?
      </div>
      <div class="interview__answer b2">
Yes, really! The point is that it’s not just tomatoes, it’s juice. You get wet! And once you get
wet, you get all cold. Everybody was freezing after the tomato fight. When it calmed down
they were like “brrrr”. And I wasn’t like that. The poncho’s totally waterproof, so my
underwear was dry. Not like everyone else’s.

Actually I’m going to art school in Paris. At the moment I’ve got a new performance
installation. And this year I’ve been acting in movies for the first time. I’ve been in two full-
length movies, both interesting roles. It’s been a busy year!

Well one movie is a horror movie, so I’m playing a ghost actually. Well, sort-of a ghost.

What was that like?
      </div>
      <div class="interview__answer b2">
It was great! Because it was my first movie, and I really come from a performance art
background. As a ghost I didn’t have so many things to say, so I was pretty comfortable for
that. And at the same time I had to really look weird, which is what I like to do in
performance too. So it was a good step into it.
