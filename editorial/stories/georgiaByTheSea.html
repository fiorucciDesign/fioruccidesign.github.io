    GEORGIA BY THE SEA

        Fun fact! The Dead Sea is the saltiest body of water in the world, set to dry out completely, experts say, by the year 2050. Fiorucci loves travel – and hates FOMO. Which is why we sent supermodel Georgia May Jagger for a splash around in these sun-drenched waters for our summer ‘17 campaign shoot. Below, in conversation with IDEA Books’ David Owen, she explains what went down.

        David Owen: So tell me about the Dead Sea shoot. You had never been there before?
      </div>
      <div class="interview__answer b2">
        Georgia May : No, never! It really is crazy. If you get the seawater in your eyes then you are literally blinded. You can’t even walk on the ground because it is encrusted with salt so it cuts into your feet. That’s why the jelly shoes became a prominent component for the shoot. I have never really been anywhere quite like it. If you were to see what was slightly out of shot, you would have seen so many older people on their weekend holiday to the Dead Sea! I think it must have been quite shocking us all arriving and me sticking out like a sore thumb!

        D: You came away with so many pictures: like you would expect coming back from a holiday.

        G: We weren’t really given a shot list, so we did what we felt in the moment and just went with it. I think it was quite amazing the way we did it. It was similar to the way my mum [ex-model Jerry Hall] describes to me how the old Vogue trips were. They used to tell them to go ahead of time, get a tan and then they would spend a week at the location. It felt very much like that kind of vibe. Whereas now, we are so used to everything being like: ‘We have ten shots and we have to do them all now’. But in fact, we actually ended up with more pictures the way we did it because there was less pressure and it felt more real.
