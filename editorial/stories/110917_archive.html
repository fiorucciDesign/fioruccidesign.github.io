    A GRAPHIC HISTORY OF FIORUCCI
  </div>

  <div class="story__lead b1 hStd " >
    As Fiorucci embarks on a colourful new chapter, what better time to take a look back at its equally colourful past? The brand that Elio Fiorucci founded back in 1967 was never just about clothes. It was a coming together of art, music and fashion that helped to define the culture of a generation. It celebrated the work of artists and designers like Keith Haring, Andy Warhol and Ettore Sottsass. It produced endless zines, posters and collectible sticker sets. It held parties at Studio 54. And all that creativity led to a lot of stuff being, well, created. Here's just some of it.

      A typical Fiorucci postcard, circa 1979. This appears on the front cover of a new book on Fiorucci, edited by David Owen and published by Rizzoli. There’s so much going on here that it’s hard to know where to start. Tigers, birds, dragonflies, superheroes, a cut-out of Twiggy in the middle… and a graphic illustrating the rights of way at a T-junction. Why? Here’s a less boring question: why not?

      For the generation who came of age in the late 70’s and early 80’s, Fiorucci meant one thing: sex. That’s thanks to Oliviero Toscani, the photographer responsible for some of Fiorucci’s most provocative artwork. Oliviero is no stranger to controversy. Around the same time that he was shooting for Fiorucci, he was also creating his iconic Benetton campaigns.

        True story! If it wasn’t for Fiorucci, i-D might not have survived the ‘80s. Founded by former Vogue art director Terry Jones in 1980, the magazine soon found itself struggling for distribution. In 1983, while Terry was moonlighting for Fiorucci, Oliviero Toscani came on board as the magazine’s global distributor. This is the cover of “Issue Zero” of the i-D Fiorucci fanzine.

      What do you do when your company turns 15? You throw a huge party, that’s what. Fiorucci’s 15th birthday was held at Studio 54. Maripol was in charge of organising the entertainment. She booked a then-unknown artist by the name of Madonna. There was cake. It was fun. Here’s just one of the photographs taken on the night. Bellissima!

      The Fiorucci archives in Milan are a treasure trove of ‘70s and ‘80s graphic design. These two images are particularly special. The twin angels are the brand’s most recognisable motif, and now adorn the walls of the Fiorucci store on Brewer Street, Soho. As for the iconic ‘Swordfish Girl’, just look at her. Sex, power, graphic energy, fun... it’s everything Fiorucci stands for in a picture. We’re hooked.

      Here’s a picture of Keith Haring in Milan, circa 1984. Fiorucci had invited the artist to decorate the walls of its store. Over the course of a day and a night in October, this is what he did to them. He brought along his 16 year old protégé, Angel Ortiz, a.k.a. Little Angle 2 (LA2). The pair also left their mark on a pair of Safety Jeans, which have survived and are now safely stored in the Fiorucci archives.

      Think Panini and you think football, right? Wrong! In 1984, Fiorucci collaborated with the Italian sticker manufacturer on a set of high-impact, highly collectible stickers that are still much in demand today. Got, got, need, swap, got, need, need, swap...
